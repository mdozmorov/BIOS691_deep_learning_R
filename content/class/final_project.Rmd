# Final project

- Teams of two are encouraged
- Due date is 07/12/2020
- Ask questions by e-mail

## Data

- Register on [kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/)
- Select and enter one of the completed [Kaggle competitions](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions) based on topics/code learned in-class.  Examples:
    - [Kannada MNIST](https://www.kaggle.com/c/Kannada-MNIST) - handwritten digit recognition written using the Kannada script
    - [Kuzushiji Recognition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/kuzushiji-recognition) - transcribe ancient Kuzushiji into contemporary Japanese characters
    - [Aerial Cactus Identification](https://www.kaggle.com/c/aerial-cactus-identification) - determine whether an image contains a columnar cactus
    - [Movie Review Sentiment Analysis](https://www.kaggle.com/c/movie-review-sentiment-analysis-kernels-only) - classify the sentiment of sentences from the Rotten Tomatoes dataset
    - [Dog Breed Identification](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dog-breed-identification) - determine the breed of a dog in an image

- Explore [Kaggle datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) for other interesting projects

## Solution

- Create your code in RMarkdown
- Describe and implement data download and processing
- Select, justify, and implement a network architecture suitable for the data
- Train and evaluate the performance of the network
- Tweak network architecture, if needed, to improve model performance
- Explain all steps, describe the achieved performance

Many Kaggle competitions allow for late submissions in the form of text files with, e.g., samples and predicted classes. Such submissions will be benchmarked against previous submissions, and you will be able to compare how your model performs with respect to previous solutions.

# Submission

- Register on [GitHub](https://github.com/). Learn about GitHub in the section [4 - Git and GitHub](https://mdozmorov.github.io/BIOS691.2018/syllabus/) of the [Reproducible research tools](https://mdozmorov.github.io/BIOS691.2018/)
- Create a repository with your code solving the selected competition
    - Your code should run (knit) with minimal modifications, e.g., adjusting path
    - If teamwork, ensure that both participants committed to the repository
