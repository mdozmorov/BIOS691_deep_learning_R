# In-class, [deep-learning-with-r-notebooks](https://github.com/jjallaire/deep-learning-with-r-notebooks)

- `4.4-overfitting-and-underfitting.Rmd` - IMDB, comparins smaller and bigger network performance
- `6.1-one-hot-encoding-of-words-or-characters.Rmd` - One-hot-encoding toy example
- `6.1-using-word-embeddings.Rmd` - embedding, IMDB, using pretrained Glove model

# Self-study, [dl-keras-tf](https://github.com/rstudio-conf-2020/dl-keras-tf)

- Review and run `dl-keras-tf/materials/06-word-embeddings/01-word-embeddings.Rmd` and `02-pretrained-word-embeddings.Rmd`, parallels `6.1-using-word-embeddings.Rmd`
- Review and run `dl-keras-tf/materials/03-recipe/01-starter-recipe.Rmd` - MNIST example, data preparation, optimizer selection, callbacks, parameter grid search, L2 regularization, dropout, confusion matrix
