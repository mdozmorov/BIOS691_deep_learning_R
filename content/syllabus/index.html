<h2>Course Description</h2>
<p>Deep learning is an actively growing machine learning field for many research and application areas, such as computer vision, speech recognition, timeseries forecasting. It is becoming the state-of-the-art approach among machine learning methods, especially suitable for extracting useful information from large, unstructured datasets.</p>
<p>This course is an introduction to deep learning theory and practice. It will cover basics of neural network architectures, main statistical concepts behind training neural networks, and implementation aspects. The main focus will be on programming deep neural networks using TensorFlow and its Keras front-end in R, although the knowledge will also be useful for Python practitioners. The goal of this course is to build foundation for understanting and implementing deep learning approaches, and provide material for further development.</p>

<!--
### Late Policy

Students get 1 free assignment to submit late without penalties. Please email us through Sakai that you need more time. If you need accomodation, please email us so we can figure out a way to help you.

Graduate Studies in the OHSU School of Medicine is committed to providing grades to students in a timely manner. Course instructors will provide students with information in writing at the beginning of each
course that describes the grading policies and procedures including but not limited to evaluation criteria, expected time needed to grade individual student examinations and type of feedback they will provide.

Class grades are due to the Registrar by the Friday following the week of finals. However, on those occasions when a grade has not been submitted by the deadline, the following procedure shall be followed:

1)  The Department/Program Coordinator will immediately contact the Instructor requesting the missing grade, with a copy to the Program Director and Registrar.

2)  If the grade is still overdue by the end of next week, the Department/Program Coordinator will email the Department Chair directly, with a copy to the Instructor and Program Director requesting resolution of the missing grade.

3)  If, after an additional week the grade is still outstanding, the student or Department/Program Coordinator may petition the Office of Graduate students for final resolution.

1.  *For courses that are run by a specific department.*

2.  *For the conjoined courses (course number is preceded by CON\_ that
    are run by Graduate Studies.*
