## Final project

The objectives of this class include  
- Become proficient in selecting the correct types of deep learning models
- Implement deep neural networks using Keras/TensorFlow and R programming language
- Train and evaluate the performance of deep neural networks

To help you with this, you will solve one of the [Kaggle competitions](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) based on topics/code learned in-class. See [Final project](class/final_project) for more details

- Teams of two are encouraged
- Due date is 07/12/2020
